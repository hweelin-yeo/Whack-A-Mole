# Whack-A-Mole
Embedded Systems Project

Whack-a-Mole is a hardware game, equipped with a SNES controller and an LED board, where users can “whack” moles. Moles appear on the LED boards randomly and players have to hit the moles in the right position with a hammer, denoted by a green LED pointer, before they disappear to gain a point. Players use the SNES controller to move the hammer around, and click the 'A' button to whack the mole. Once the player reaches 9 points, the game ends.
